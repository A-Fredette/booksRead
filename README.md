# MyReads Project

This is a sample app that serves as a digital bookshelf for the user. There are three shelves: "Currently Reading", "Want to Read" and "Read" on the home page. By using the green icon in the lower right of each book icon, the user can change the bookshelf of each book. The green plus icon in the bottom right of the home page opens a search page that allows the user to search for new books to add to their bookshelf.

## Installation

To get started using the app:

* Download or clone into this repository
* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`

## Notes
This app was built to demonstrate proficiency programming with the React language as part of the requirements for Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree Program.
